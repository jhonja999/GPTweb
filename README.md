- CSS animations and transitions for smooth UI
- Glassmorphism effects using modern CSS features

### Model Information

The application uses the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, which:
- Runs completely in the browser
- Requires no external API calls
- Provides fast response times
- Maintains privacy by processing all data locally

## üé® Customization

### Changing Colors

The UI uses CSS variables for easy customization. Edit the `:root` section in the CSS:

```css
:root {
  --glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  --glass-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Modifying Animations

You can adjust meteor animation timing by modifying the interval in the JavaScript:

```javascript
setInterval(createMeteor, 2000); // Change 2000 to your preferred interval
```
